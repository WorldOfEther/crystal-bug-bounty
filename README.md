# The World of Ether Bug Bounty Program

The World of Ether Bug Bounty 

The 1st World of Ether Bug Bounty is **officially open**, with a reward pool of **$20,000!**

It’s of the utmost importance to us that these particular crystal contracts are secure and players kept safe. With the launch of World of Ether nearing, we invite the blockchain community to help with this.

If you’re a developer who’d like to take part, here’s what you need to know:

## World of Ether Crystal

- Crystal contracts are `ERC-20` tokens with limited added functionality. They only allow minting from 2 designated proxy contracts, one of which is a sales contract 
- The sales contract 
- Each of the 5 crystals has 1 ‘use’ function that initiates logic in proxy contract after tokens are transferred to it
- Crystals are `ERC20` tokens and, as such, can be sold and traded on 3rd party platforms and exchanges.

**For a list of basic operations, please see [here](./WorldOfEther-Crystal-Basics.md).** 

## Scope

The bounty program is running on the Rinkeby Test Network and will be open until TIME EST + DATE.

All code necessary for this bounty is publically available within this repo.

The exploits, vulnerabilities, and issues we most care about are:

- Stealing a Crystal.
- Manipulating the use or purchase of a crystal.
- Anything that ‘breaks’ the contracts.
- Any sort of malfunction.

## Rules & Rewards

- Issues that our team already know about, either through our own testing or through submission, are not eligible for bounty rewards.
- This bounty is only concerning the World of Ether smart contracts included in this repo.
- Reports will only be accepted via GitHub issues submitted to this repo.
- The World of Ether team will look at several variables in determining rewards. Eligibility, compensation, and everything having to do with rewards are ultimately up to the WoE team.
- Having a safe and secure dApp improves the entire blockchain ecosystem. Spam and actions that are clearly not in good faith will not be tolerated. Please use your discretion to only act in ways that are reasonable!
